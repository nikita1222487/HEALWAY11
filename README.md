# APP-DEV-CONTEST
App name:HEAL WAY:
1.Problem Statement:
Living healthy is not an option anymore,it is the need of the hour.Last year with the surge in Covid-19 cases , India’s healthcare infrastructure was collapsing. Technology has become an inevitable part of our daily lives,so why can’t we use the same for making the society more healthier.Generally ,people in India do not go to doctors unless they are severely ill and the diet is not sufficient enough to provide all the necessary supplements to the body.So we can use mobile applications for the day-to-day medical care that our body needs ,Mobile applications are easily accessible  In the modern times ,your mobile is always with you,so let it take care of you. 


2.Proposed Solution with screenshots:
This project proposes a “Health and Wellness Platform” for every age group.The health profile generated will tell your BMI in one click. It will provide the information of supplements your body requires  according to the minor health issues you face and a recommended diet which fits your Indian lifestyle and local culture.Maintain your healthy life with the timetable feature ,where you can set the timer for every activity.To keep a stress free mind ,we will add a relax section where the user can listen to peaceful music.In case of emergency,the app can help you get the ambulance of the nearest hospital.The project’s scope is to make it interactive for the rural part of india and adding a section specifically for children of age 1-5,pregnant and new mothers.The ultimate goal is to make India Healthy for a Healthy Future.
